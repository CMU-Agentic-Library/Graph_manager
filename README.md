# Graph Manager

Graph Manager focuses on task-conditioned skill graphs and the VLM interface around them. The planned workflow uses visual observations, a user's task, and a skill library to produce semantic subgoals and a skill subgraph for each subgoal. This repository will define how those outputs are represented, parsed, and checked against existing skill contracts. The robot skills and benchmark scenes are maintained by collaborators in the same project.

## Skill Library v1

The initial [Skill Library](skill_library/README.md) defines model-facing contracts for the currently implemented ZenoBench capabilities, conditional composition hints, and separate execution-side bindings. The full public catalog is small enough to provide to the model at once. Contracts describe reusable capabilities; the model will still propose a new Skill DAG for each task. The current library is a documented interface and does not yet include a graph runner or independent visual verifiers.

## Goal wording baseline

The five tasks below provide paired goal descriptions for a future comparison. **Original instruction** preserves the English task instruction from ZenoBench verbatim. **Detailed goal** makes the existing success conditions and permitted alternatives explicit. It describes the desired result without prescribing a skill, execution sequence, or object location in a particular scene variant.

Both wordings are intended to be evaluated against the same ZenoBench success conditions. A later comparison should keep the scene variants, available skills, execution system, and evaluator fixed so that goal wording is the variable under study. The detailed wording does not reveal which optional objects are present in a particular scene.

### Collect fruits

**Original instruction**

> Collect the fruits and place them in a container on the low bookcase in the living room.

**Detailed goal**

> Place both the apple and the orange inside the same available container, either a fruit basket or a serving tray. Leave that container upright on the low bookcase in the living room. Leave all doors and drawers closed. Do not leave any task object that began more than 10 cm above the floor lying on the floor, unless it is inside a container.

### Tidy toys

**Original instruction**

> Collect the toys and store them in the toy box.

**Detailed goal**

> Place the toy car, toy block, and rubber duck inside the same available container, either the toy box or a storage basket. Leave the chosen container upright. Leave all doors and drawers closed. Do not leave any task object that began more than 10 cm above the floor lying on the floor, unless it is inside a container.

### Shelve books

**Original instruction**

> Collect the books and place them on the bookshelf.

**Detailed goal**

> Place both books on a bookcase. Each book may be on either available bookcase, on its top or on a shelf level. Leave all doors and drawers closed. Do not leave any task object that began more than 10 cm above the floor lying on the floor, unless it is inside a container.

### Set up breakfast

**Original instruction**

> Set up the dining table for breakfast.

**Detailed goal**

> Arrange a breakfast place setting on the dining table with one plate or bowl, one cup or mug, and a spoon. Keep the selected plate or bowl and the selected cup or mug upright. All three selected items must be on the dining table and within 0.5 m of one another. Leave all doors and drawers closed. Do not leave any task object that began more than 10 cm above the floor lying on the floor, unless it is inside a container.

### Prepare the study desk

**Original instruction**

> Prepare the study desk with a notebook, a pen, and a mug.

**Detailed goal**

> Place a notebook, either a pen or a pencil, and either a mug or a cup on the study desk. Keep the selected mug or cup upright. Leave all doors and drawers closed. Do not leave any task object that began more than 10 cm above the floor lying on the floor, unless it is inside a container.
